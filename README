C Algorithms

The C programming language includes a very limited standard library in
comparison to other modern programming languages.  This is a collection of
common Computer Science algorithms which may be used in C projects effectively and in a efficient manner.

The code is licensed under the ISC license (a simplified version of the BSD
license that is functionally identical).  As such, it may legitimately be
reused in any project, whether Proprietary or Open Source.
