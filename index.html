<h1> C Algorithms </h1>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language">C 
Programming Language</a> has a much smaller standard library compared
to other more modern programming languages such as Java or Python. 
In particular, it lacks implementations of many common data structures
and algorithms.  This is a collection of such algorithms to attempt
to alleviate this problem.
<p>
The source code is released under the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>, 
which is functionally identical to the BSD license.
As such, it can be freely modified and reused in any project, either
proprietary or free.  It is written in 100% ANSI standard C.
Each data structure is written to be independent from the others in the
library, allowing particular data structures to be included in projects as
needed.

<p>
The library includes an extensive test suite.
You can read some information about the testing strategy used for the library
<a href="testing.html">here</a>.
If you do find any bugs, please report them on
<a href="https://github.com/fragglet/c-algorithms/issues">Github</a>.

<p>

The latest release, <b>v1.2.0</b>, can be found
<a href="https://github.com/fragglet/c-algorithms/releases">here</a>.
The <a href="doc/">documentation</a> for the current release is also available.

<p>
The current source code can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/fragglet/c-algorithms">the Git repository</a>.
